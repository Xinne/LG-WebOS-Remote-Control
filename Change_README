In the readme the following is mentioned regarding the following special icons on the remote:
  - icon: disney
    name: Disney
  - icon: dazn
    name: Dazn
    
    After testing I noticed the Disney button requires the following name:
    
   - icon: disney
     name: Disney+
     
     Otherwise the button does not work at all
